## Dom-Project1-ARS-Bank

Basically this is a java script DOM (Document Object Model) project.
This is full responsive website for all kinds of device. Here I try to calculate Bank deposit and withdraw calculation. Also I add a simple login system.
For this site I set a email id and password. Then you get second page and then you calculate deposit and withdraw calculation.
